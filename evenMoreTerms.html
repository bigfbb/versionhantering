      <h1>Advanced GitHub terminology</h1>
      <ul>
         <li><span>Working directory</span>The working directory is a single checkout of one version of the project. This essentially means if you checkout a branch (e.g. master) and are sat on a particular commit (e.g. HEAD), your working directory is the "umbrella" term for all your files and folders.
         </li>
         <li><span>Staging</span>Staging is a step before the commit process in git. That is, a commit in git is performed in two steps: staging and actual commit. As long as a changeset is in the staging area, git allows you to edit it as you like
         </li>
         <li><span>HEAD</span>The term HEAD refers to the current commit you are viewing.
            By default, youâ€™ll view the tip of the master branch on a repository, unless the main branch of your repository has a different name. The tip of the master branch is the most recent commit on the main branch of your codebase
         </li>
         <li><span>Revert</span>A revert will retain the commits you want to undo and create a new commit that inverts the undesired commit.
         </li>
         <li><span>Reset</span>git reset is a powerful command that is used to undo local changes to the state of a Git repo
         </li>
